### Luck = [Doing Things] * [Telling People]   

<br> 

### :man_technologist: I'm 4-Leafs-Code and I'm interested in Web and Software development. 
### I'm also Clover Baxter and a Prisoner at Maine Correctional Center in Maine, U.S.A.

I've come to realize that I am an incredible force. Being a prisoner and accomplishing   
all I do verifies my ability to get things done when the need arises. I'm released anytime   
between now and March of 2025 depending on the circumstances of my release. I can work    
remotely in this facility and if you are interested in hiring me, please reach out to me    
or my current housing facility. 

I am a Computer Technology student with a Mentorship from [Project Reclass.](https://www.projectreclass.org/).  
I started to learn to program in March 2022 and discovered I have a niche for it.    
I have learned/am learning UX\UI design, frontend, backend, databases, and cloud     
networking. I am a Full Stack Developer.   
<br>   

ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on building and deploying a networking site for Maine prisoner    
reentry resource advocates to be able to connect and collaborate. I'm looking for some help    
building the site if you are interested check out the [Reentry Repo](https://github.com/4-Leafs-Code/Reentry).

I am the owner of [FearlessTech](https://github.com/FearlessTech). My organization was built    
so all of the wonderful collaborators and contributors I've worked with can bring "for a good cause"     
projects to the table. I'd like to continue building projects that will improve the lives of some     
group, somewhere in the world as I did with the startup repository, Reentry.
